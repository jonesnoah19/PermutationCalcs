Press 1 to view all of the permutations of an input size.
  Input an integer N, and the output is a list of all of the permutations of N elements.
Press 2 to see information on a permutaion, and display a graph of it.
  Input a permutation as integers separated by spaces (for example: 3 4 1 2), and it outputs the number of inversions, exceedances, cycles, whether the permutation is shallow, and a diagram.
